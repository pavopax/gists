	tmux ls                     # list sessions

	tmux new -s mysession       # create new

	tmux attach -t mysession    # or, attach recent:  tmux a
	
	tmux detach                 # or Ctrl-b d

	tmux kill-session -t session-name


`tmux` manages your terminal windows to help you organize your projects.

Install with `brew install tmux`

From https://danielmiessler.com/study/tmux/ :

**Sessions** are for an overall theme, such as work, or experimentation, or
sysadmin.

**Windows** are for projects within that theme. So perhaps within your
experimentation session you have a window titled noderestapi, and one titled
lua sample.

**Panes** are for views within your current project. So within your sysadmin
session, which has a logs window, you may have a few panes for access logs,
error logs, and system logs.



Tmux shortcuts 1 of 2 (basics)
===============================================================================
*Commands in the same group are equivalent. ctrl commands work inside tmux
session; tmux commands run from terminal*

	tmux ls
	ctrl + b, s

	tmux attach -t mysession 
	tmux a -t mysession
	tmux a	                # attach most recently used session
	
	tmux detach 
	ctrl + b, d

	tmux kill-session -t session-name

SCROLL mode:

	ctrl + b, [		# now, you can use PgUp/PgDown. q to exit

My `.tmux.conf` config file is in [my dotfiles repo](https://github.com/pavopax/dotfiles).

If you run on local and restart your machine, then `tmux` is gone. The solution
is: https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tmux-resurrect

Its key bindings:

	prefix + Ctrl-s - save
	prefix + Ctrl-r - restore
